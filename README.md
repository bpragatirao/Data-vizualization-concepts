# 📊 Data Analytics & Visualization Portfolio

This repository contains a series of end-to-end data science problems and solutions. Each project focuses on building robust, scalable pipelines—from initial data cleaning to final model comparison.

## 🚀 Technical Core
The solutions are implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** using **Python** and leverage the standard data science stack:
* **Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
* **Outlier Detection:** Identifying anomalies using Z-score, IQR, and Isolation Forests.
* **Imputation:** Handling missing values through Mean/Median, KNN, and Iterative Importers.

### 2. Feature & Model Engineering
* **Feature Selection:** Dimensionality reduction using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Correlation Analysis.
* **Regression & Regularization:** Implementing Linear, Polynomial, Ridge (L2), and Lasso (L1) regression to prevent overfitting.

### 3. Validation & Comparison
* **Validation Strategies:** K-Fold Cross-Validation and Train-Test-Validation splits.
* **Model Comparison:** Evaluating performance using R², MSE, and MAE across various algorithms.
* **Pipeline Design:** Using `sklearn.pipeline` to automate preprocessing and modeling steps for cleaner code.
